clamav
=========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/robertdebock/ansible-role-clamav.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/robertdebock/ansible-role-clamav)

Install and configure clamav on your system.

Example Playbook
----------------

This example is taken from `molecule/default/playbook.yml`:
```yaml
---
- name: Converge
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: false

  roles:
    - robertdebock.bootstrap
    - robertdebock.epel
    - robertdebock.clamav

```

Also see a [full explanation and example](https://robertdebock.nl/how-to-use-these-roles.html) on how to use these roles.

Role Variables
--------------

These variables are set in `defaults/main.yml`:
```yaml
---
# defaults file for clamav

# SELinux has to be configured to allow scanning. Set clamav_can_scan_system to
# either "yes" or "no". Only has effect on systems that support SELinux.
clamav_can_scan_system: yes

# Configure any parameter using "regexp" and "line". The parameter "regexp"
# contains the line that needs to be replaced. The replacement is stored in
# "line".
clamav_configuration:
  - line: "Example"
    state: absent
  - line: "TCPSocket 10025"
  - line: "TCPAddr 127.0.0.1"
  - line: "LogFile /var/log/clamd.scan"

# To update all packages installed by this roles, set `clamav_package_state` to `latest`.
clamav_package_state: present

# Some Docker containers do not allow managing services, rebooting and writing
# to some locations in /etc. The role skips tasks that will typically fail in
# Docker. With this parameter you can tell the role to -not- skip these tasks.
clamav_ignore_docker: yes

```
